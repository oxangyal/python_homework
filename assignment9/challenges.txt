It wasn't obvious where the list of top 10 vulnerabilities was located because the vulnerabilities are not labeled with unique ids or classes,
and the page contains multiple ul elements, making it harder to locate the correct one.
I inspected the elements and determened that the correct list was inside the second <ul> element within the section that has id="sec-main".
I constructed an XPath for each list item (li[1] through li[10]) inside this <ul>.
Another challenge was extracting only the vulnerability title without any extra surrounding text. Inside each <a> tag, the title is wrapped in a
<strong> tag. To make sure I only captured the title, I used
title = element.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, "strong").text.
